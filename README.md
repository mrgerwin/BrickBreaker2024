# Brick Breaker 2024

Note there are several things that need to be fixed.

1. The paddle will stop on the left hand side but will go through the right hand side
2. The ball bounces off of the bottom of the screen instead of taking away a life and resetting the ball.  Wait, do we even have a lives variable?  Do we even have text on the screen for that?
3. When the ball hits the paddle, the velocity of the paddle in the X direction should add to the velocity of the ball in the x direction.
4. And...  There are no blocks.  And we should be able to score if we hit a block.  Use Mr. Gerwin's "Block Class" to make this happen.
5. What should happen when the lives = 0?
